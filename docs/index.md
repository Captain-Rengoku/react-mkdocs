## :simple-react: React: The UI Library

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focusing on component-based architecture and a declarative approach.

**In this section, you’ll learn:**

- What React is and how it differs from other frameworks.
- Creating components with JSX.
- Using state and props to manage dynamic data.
- The power of hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and more.
- One-way data flow and how it simplifies app logic.
- The Virtual DOM and performance benefits.

## :simple-typescript: TypeScript: Static Typing for JavaScript

TypeScript adds **type safety** to JavaScript, helping you catch errors early and refactor confidently.

**You’ll learn:**

- TypeScript syntax: types, interfaces, enums, and generics.
- Type checking functions, arrays, objects, and more.
- Writing reusable, type-safe utilities and components.
- Working with external libraries and `@types`.
- Using `tsconfig.json` to customize your build settings.
- Setting up React + TypeScript projects.
- Typing props, state, refs, and context.
- Strongly typing `useReducer` and custom hooks.
- Handling form validation and API calls with TypeScript.
- Creating scalable patterns with reusable types.

## :simple-nextdotjs: Next.js: The React Framework

Next.js builds on React by adding routing, data fetching, API routes, and full-stack capabilities—all with great defaults and performance.

**With Next.js, you’ll learn:**

- App routing: pages vs App Router, dynamic and nested routes.
- Static Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
- Server Components and client hydration in the new App directory.
- Creating API routes and integrating databases (e.g., Prisma).
- Authentication with NextAuth.js and using middleware.
- Optimizing and deploying to Vercel.
